One of the nice things about living in Durham, NC is that if you live near the [American Tobacco Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Tobacco_Trail), a ton of biking possibilities opens up. We've replaced nearly all of our car errands with bike trips: grocery shopping, pharmacy, and the kids' school are right off the trail. 

The [Tern GSD](https://www.ternbicycles.com/us/bikes/472/gsd) we got a few years ago is the best purchase I've ever made; both kids can fit on the rear seat, and there's still room up front and in the panniers for backpacks, groceries, or whatever they've found at the park. We've put about 3,000 miles on this thing so far and aren't slowing down any time soon.

The kids are 8 and 5 now, and they won't fit on the bike with me forever. I'll miss these days when they're gone.
